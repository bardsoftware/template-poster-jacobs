Dreuw & Deselaer’s Poster

Original description:
This poster template features a dark gray color scheme for content and a contrasting title and footer to highlight important information about the research. Content is laid out in two columns in a portrait orientation but changing it to landscape and increasing the number of columns is quite easy. The template makes extensive use of lists for styling which promotes a clear and concise description of research. Examples of a table, figure, equation, list and bibliography are present in the template to provide a starting point for any requirement you may have for your own poster.
